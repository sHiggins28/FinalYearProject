What you'll need:

HC-SR04
1kΩ Resistor
2kΩ Resistor
Jumper Wires

IMPORTANT. 
The sensor output signal (ECHO) on the HC-SR04 is rated at 5V. 
However, the input pin on the Raspberry Pi GPIO is rated at 3.3V. 
Sending a 5V signal into that unprotected 3.3V input port could damage your 
GPIO pins, which is something we want to avoid! 
We’ll need to use a small voltage divider circuit, consisting of two resistors, 
to lower the sensor output voltage to something our Raspberry Pi can handle.


Vcc - GPIO 5V [Pin 2}
TRIG - GPIO 23 {Pin 16}
ECHO - 1k resistor  GPIO 24 [Pin 18] in series with a 2k resistor connected between GND and the GPIO [Pin6]

Plug four of your male to female jumper wires into the pins on the HC-SR04 as follows: 
Red; Vcc, 
Blue; TRIG, 
Yellow; ECHO 
Black; GND.

Plug Vcc into the positive rail of your breadboard, and plug GND into your negative rail.

Plug GPIO 5V [Pin 2] into the positive rail, and GPIO GND [Pin 6] into the negative rail. 

Plug TRIG into a blank rail, and plug that rail into GPIO 23 [Pin 16].

Plug ECHO into a blank rail, link another blank rail using R1 (1kΩ resistor)

6. Link your R1 rail with the GND rail using R2 (2kΩ resistor).
Leave a space between the two resistors.

Add GPIO 24 [Pin 18] to the rail with your R1 (1kΩ resistor).
This GPIO pin needs to sit between R1 and R2
